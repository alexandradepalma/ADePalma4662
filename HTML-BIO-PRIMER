             <h2> Who I Am </h2>
                <p>
                  I am a New England-based undergraduate at the <strong>University of Minnesota</strong> with an expected graduation date of May 2016. I am pursuing a degree in economics, technical writing, &amp; art history. While I enjoy the analytical capabilities &amp; decision making processes that an economics education inspires, I wished to supplement my quantitative education with a qualitative one to develop my writing skills &amp; cultural understanding. I transferred to the U of MN from <strong> Emerson College </strong>, a communications &amp; arts school in Boston, MA, where I studied journalism.

             <h2> What I Do</h2>
               <p>
I have curated my college curriculum to offer a comprehensive global understanding of economics &amp; culture. I have a strong interest in the economics of coffee &amp; corn products &amp; the effects of global agricultural trade policies on developing nations in Africa, Latin America, &amp; the Caribbean &amp; have completed several research papers on these topics.  I am a certified data scientist and am currently interning for a technology company in an operations position that utilizes my background in statistics &amp; economics &amp; am looking for a full time post-graduate position that will enable me to leverage both my analytical &amp; creative skill sets.
